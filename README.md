## Welcome
This is a SIF Icon builder made with [LÃ–VE2D](https://love2d.org/) made for use with my [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) skin [LoveLive! School Idol Festival](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/539048). Please report for any issues when using the program!

## How to Use
Drag and drop any image file to the window and adjust its position and size. Set the image name and click "Create" and your icon will be generated.
To use it with my osu! skin, you must rename it to `mania-keyX.png` where `X` is any number 1 to 9 to replace any key icon in the skin.

## Caveats
* Images are saved as `128x128` whereas the mania skin uses `96x96`
* Due to Framework limitations, there might be slight graphical deformations
* Your system must support canvases in order to run the application
